**Machine Learning Models: Predicting What Factors Contribute to Student Performance**

In this project I used various Machine Learning algorithms to predict Student Performance based on their Hours Studied, Previous Scores, Sleep Hours, Sample Question Papers Practiced, and Extracurricular Activities. I used Linear Regression, KNN Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression in order to come up with the best model. Further information regarding data cleaning, methods used, and more can be found in the report in this repository.
